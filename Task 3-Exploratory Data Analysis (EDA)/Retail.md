Evaluate discounting practices to ensure they enhance sales without compromising profit margins, especially in regions like the Central region where profit loss is observed despite high discounts.

### 3. Regional Market Optimization:

### 4. Customer Segmentation and Engagement:
   - Tailor marketing messages and promotions to different types of customers, like individual consumers, corporate clients, and home offices. Provide personalized interactions and exceptional service to keep customers engaged and satisfied, encouraging them to return and boosting long-term profitability.

### 5. Streamline Shipping Processes and Cost Efficiency:
